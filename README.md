# Working-with-Country-Data-from-csv-files

### This project is a program that allows the user to input a country and a statistic, and it will display data about the chosen country and statistic. The program imports three .csv files, which contain data about population, threatened species, and general information about countries. The user is prompted to input a country from a list of countries, and the program verifies that the input is a valid country. The user is then prompted to input a statistic from a list of statistics, and the program verifies that the input is a valid statistic. If the inputted statistic is one that pertains to a specific year, the user is prompted to input a year. The program then creates an object of a class called "CountryData" with the inputted country and statistic as its attributes, and it uses this object to call a method called "print_all_stats", which prints the name and statistic of the object. If the inputted statistic is one that does not pertain to a specific year, the program calls a method called "print_stats_graph", which creates and displays a graph showing the chosen statistic for the chosen country.
